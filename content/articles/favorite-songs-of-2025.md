It's the end of January, which means I've had time to agonize over the ritual of trimming my favorite songs from last year down to a playlist of just 20. This time with brief commentary!

1. **Dominoes - Twin Shadow**: Every song on this album is a remake of a song from his previous album. Easily my song of the year.
2. **WHERE IS MY HUSBAND! - RAYE**: I vow to karaoke this one day.
3. **Defeat - Flock of Dimes**:  I have a playlist called "Why don't they make the whole song like that one part?" and this song is on it. Jenn Wasner continues to be amazing.
4. **Strobe - Armlock**: Sounds so much like Pinback that I originally thought it was new Pinback.
5. **What It Sounds Like - HUNTR/X, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, REI AMI, KPop Demon Hunters Cast**: This rivals Daft Punk's *Too Long* for *Best Arena Concert Movie Climax Song*.
6. **Ratgirl - Pearly Drops**
7. **Something for Somebody - Mallrat**
8. **JAM! - BETWEEN FRIENDS**: The last two minutes of this song is your reward for making it through the first two minutes of this song.
9. **Move On - Jaguar Sun, Jesse Maranger**
10. **WE WERE JUST HERE - Just Mustard**
11. **Another Tangerine - The Barr Brothers**: Sounds a lot like *Even the Darkness Has Arms* but you don't hear me complaining. One of the most underrated bands of all time.
12. **Deep End - Twin Shadow**
13. **Lùlù - Lùlù**: I have no idea what they are saying but this song rips.
14. **Virtue - Mallrat**
15. **Egg - Djo**: You just gonna let fear take that?
16. **Tennessee - Kesha, Orville Peck, Hudson Mohawke, Tayla Parx**: Not what I expected, but lots of fun.
17. **LIE DOWN.. - Saya Gray**
18. **No Broke Boys - E Disco Lines, Tinashe**: I found this song thanks to my seven year-old. She clearly has good taste.
19. **Sugar - NoSo**
20. **nobody matters but You - Leyla Ebrahimi**: This song takes a hard turn halfway through. I would be a mess if I ever saw this live.

I've been doing this for over a decade but this is the first time I've bothered putting it on my website. The requirements are arbitrary but simple: Assemble a playlist of my favorite 20 songs that were released in the past year. This unfortunately means that songs released in previous years that I hadn't discovered yet are ineligible, but hey, I don't make the rules. (I do make the rules)
